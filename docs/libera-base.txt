Libera Base
===========


Directories
-----------

`toolchains/`::
Defines the compilers used to build Libera components.
+
--
`linux-arm`::
Standard cross compiler for Libera 1.46, used to build user space tools to run
on Libera 1.46.  Toolchain built using crosstool with gcc version 3.4.5 and
glibc 2.3.6.
`linux-arm_3.3.3`::
Original cross compiler for Libera 1.46, as distributed by Instrumentation
Technologies, using gcc version 3.3.3 and glibc 2.3.2.  Used for building
kernel modules? 
`linux-arm_el`::
Cross compiler to target Libera with EABI, targeting Libera 2.00 and the DLS
rootfs.  Building using crosstool-NG with gcc version 4.3.2 and glibc 2.7.
`native`::
Native compiler.
--


`msp430/`::
Kernel driver for MSP430 voltage monitoring device.  Creates device
`/dev/msp0` in Libera.


`libera/`::
Kernel driver for Libera.  Creates `/dev/libera.*` device nodes.


`u-boot/`::
U-boot updater.  Depends on a pre-built u-boot and generates the u-boot
upgrader.


`rootfs/`::
Rootfs builder.



Generated Components
--------------------

The following components are generated in the `$(INSTALL_ROOT)` directory.

U-boot upgrader::
Tool for ensuring that u-boot is up to date and for managing the u-boot
configuration.


External Dependencies
---------------------

The Libera Base builder has the following external dependencies:

Toolchain dependencies::
The toolchains required to build components for Libera are specified in the
`toolchains/` directory.  All the toolchain definitions define
`TOOLCHAIN_VERSION` and `COMPILER_PREFIX` symbols which are then used by the
`BINUTILS_DIR` definition in the top level `CONFIG` file.

Kernel builder::
The libera kernel is configured and build by a separate directory located by
the `KERNEL_TOP` symbol.

U-Boot::
A pre-built u-boot, not managed by this build, needs to be given.  


Configuration
-------------

The top level `CONFIG` file is used to configure the external dependencies and
where builds should be located.  The following symbols are defined and can be
overridden if required in a `CONFIG.local` file.

`BUILD_ROOT`::
This is where the entire libera base build will occur.

`INSTALL_ROOT`::
This is where installed components will be placed ready to be run.

`BINUTILS_DIR`::
The toolchain dependencies assume a common pattern for locating the
toolchains; if this is not suitable, it will be necessary to define an
appropriate value for `BINUTILS_DIR` in each `toolchains` entry.

`KERNEL_TOP`::
This is the kernel build tree.  It needs to support the following two make
targets, used by this build process:
+
--
`make -s -C $(KERNEL_TOP) TARGET=libera-2.6 print-build-dir`::
Prints absolute path to the directory where the kernel is built.

`make -s -C $(KERNEL_TOP) TARGET=libera-2.6 print-kernel-version`::
Prints kernel version, in `uname -r` format.
--

`U_BOOT_TOP`::
This is where the built u-boot files are located.  This directory must contain
the following two files:
+
--
`mkimage`::
This is the u-boot `mkimage` tool used to assemble u-boot loadable images.
`u-boot.bin`::
This should be the u-boot image in binary format ready to be copied directly
to sector 0 of the flash.
