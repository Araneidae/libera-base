Upgrading Libera to DLS rootfs
==============================

Work to Do
----------

Documentation (stuff to go in here)

* Want to pick up 2.6.32 kernel when it's released: this should eliminate all
of our local patches, as everything has now gone into the mainstream kernel.
Unfortunately they're not in 2.6.31.

* Probably worth upgrading to a more recent busybox, but will need to do
something about the bug which converts 0x80000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF.

* Need to update the rootfs:

** Documentation
** Handling nfs boot for multiple targets
** Would like to build from outside rootfs


EPICS Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now have a bit of a dangling issue with the EPICS driver.  The 3.14.10 build
uses targets named `linux-arm_gnueabi`, while 3.14.11 introduces



Upgrading U-Boot
----------------

The directory `./u-boot` creates tools and scripts for performing a u-boot
upgrade.  The makefile `./u-boot/Makefile` places the resulting build in the
directory pointed to by `U_BOOT_TARGET_DIR`, currently defined in `./CONFIG`
as `/home/libera/nfs/testing/u-boot-upgrade`.

The current u-boot upgrade only works on Libera 1.46.


Booting Libera from tftp
------------------------

The following environment should be set in u-boot:

.Libera 1.46 u-boot configuration for Libera in storage ring
----
baudrate=115200
bootargs=root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttyS0,115200 mem=64M
bootcmd=bootm 80000
bootdelay=5
ipaddr=172.23.204.2
netmask=255.255.240.0
serverip=172.23.194.1
stdin=serial
stdout=serial
stderr=serial
----

To perform a working NFS boot.  First ensure that pc13 is running as an NFS
server by running `/usr/sbin/showmount -e pc13`.  If this fails, run `sudo
/etc/init.d/nfs start` on pc13.

.A manual boot transcript
----
u-boot$ setenv serverip 172.23.240.3
u-boot$ setenv ipaddr 172.23.252.1
u-boot$ 
u-boot$ 
----

This currently works!
