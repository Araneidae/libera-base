DLS Rootfs
----------

To install Libera DLS rootfs from i-Tech install follow these steps:

1.  Connect Libera machine to serial console and ethernet
2.  Boot machine and log in on serial console (root/Jungle)
3.  Run these commands:

    # pkill udhcpc.*
    # ifconfig eth0 172.23.252.10 netmask 255.255.240.0
    # mount 172.23.240.5:/exports/libera/nfs /mnt
    # /mnt/upgrade-DLS-1.1/rootfs/upgrade-libera confirm

    At this point the DLS rootfs will have been installed, but some manual
    post-installation steps will be required.

4.  Run 'mount -o remount,rw /' to enable the remaining steps.

5.  Add 'gateway 172.23.240.254' to /etc/network/interfaces and then run:

    # /etc/init.d/network restart
    # /etc/init.d/mount-extra start

The system is now working, though a host name will not have been set.


EBPM Post Install
-----------------

At this point can complete installation of EBPM by the following steps:

# /mnt/nfs/upgrade-DLS-1.1/drivers/install-drivers
# mkdir /etc/libera
# /mnt/prod/R3.14.12.3/ioc/Libera/2.05.16/install_d/libera-install-ioc -fa SR
# /opt/bin/install-fpga /mnt/work/hardware/Libera/fpga-testing/ebpm/v3.00.5/
# /opt/bin/configure-network -w TS-DI-EBPM-08

Reboot and all is done.


TMBF Post Install
-----------------

Similar process, but installation of FPGA is more manual:

# /mnt/prod/R3.14.12.3/ioc/TMBF/3.2/install_d/tmbf-install-ioc -fa
# /opt/bin/configure-network -w TS-DI-TMBF-01
# cp /mnt/prod/hardware/LiberaBBFP/v3.00.0/neutrino_hbpp_top.bin \
    /opt/lib/tmbf.bin.v3.00.0
# ln -s tmbf.bin.v3.00.0 /opt/lib/tmbf.bin

Again can now reboot.
