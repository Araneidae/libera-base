This directory collects together components concerned with managing the
configuration of the Diamond maintained Libera distribution.

The following activities are supported:

 * Building and installing the Diamond Libera rootfs.  This can be used to
   upgrade an Instrumentation Technologies Libera to the Diamond Libera
   distribution base, or to update an existing Diamond Libera system.

 * Build Libera kernel.

 * Build Libera device driver.

 * Install and upgrade Libera device driver and FPGA firmware.

 * Install basic scripts and tools needed by Libera process.


This package depends on:

 * The DLS rootfs builder package.

 * A built u-boot, providing u-boot.bin and mkimage.

 * Cross compiling toolchains.

This package provides:

 * Libera rootfs.

 * Kernel.  This is build either from locally managed patches on a stock
   source, or using a specified source tree.

 * Fpga tools: pf, Monitor, fpga_init.

 * Healthd and its associated scripts.

 * MSP430 device driver and firmware.

 * Libera device driver.

 * Diamond distribution installer.  This upgrades any iTech or DLS Libera to
   the DLS Libera distribution.

 * EBPM installer.  This installs the extra components required to run the
   Libera EBPM: fpga tools, healthd, msp, Libera device driver. 


Distribution Installer.

 * Upgrades from iTech 1.46, 1.60-1.80, 2.00+ or DLS Libera to DLS Libera.

 * Installs u-boot, kernel, rootfs.

 * Optionally runs EBPM installer?  Maybe a separate step.

The installer should retain the following settings across the install:

 * Network configuration: ip, mask, gateway, hostname or dhcp.

 * /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

 * Server identification keys.  Will need to run dropbearconvert on openssh
   keys.


Notes:

Need to copy rootfs and other structures: top level make file with separate
configuration to locate the external dependencies.
