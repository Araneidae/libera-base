This directory builds the tools required to upgrade u-boot and update the
u-boot configuration.  The following files and subdirectories are here:

mtd-rw/
    Libera 1.46 kernel module to make the mtd0 and mtd1 (u-boot and config)
    partitions writeable.  Not required for more recent kernels, as we've not
    troubled to make these partitions read only.

tools/
    Supporting tools.

update-u-boot
    Script to perform safe u-boot upgrade.


The following utilities are provided in the tools directory:

readmem
        readmem <start-address> <length>
    Copies the requested block from physical memory to stdout.  Used to read
    the programmed u-boot image. 

bindiff
        bindiff [-q] <file>
    Compares stdin and <file>, returns an error code if a difference is
    detected, otherwise returns error code 0.  Used to verify the u-boot
    image.

makeenv
        makeenv <block-size> [<env-size>]
    Reads a u-boot environment from stdin and writes an mtd block image with
    the correct checksum to stdout ready to be written to flash.

readenv
        readenv
    Interprets the input as a u-boot environment and writes it to stdout as a
    sequence of lines; implements the bash script:
        tail -c+5 | tr '\0' '\n' | sed '/^$/q'

padff
        padff <pad-char> <pad-length>
    Pads stdin with <pad-char> up to <pad-length> and writes result to stdout.
    Used to prepare u-boot.bin to be written.
